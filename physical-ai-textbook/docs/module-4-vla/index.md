# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Models

## Overview

In the final module (Weeks 11-13), you'll integrate Vision-Language-Action models to enable natural language understanding and high-level decision-making for autonomous humanoid robots.

**Duration:** 3 weeks (30 hours estimated)
**Weeks:** 11-13
**Prerequisites:** Modules 1-3, basic understanding of transformer models

## Learning Objectives

1. **Understand VLA Architecture** - Explain how VLAs combine vision, language, and action for robotics
2. **Integrate Natural Language** - Enable robots to understand and execute natural language commands
3. **Implement Humanoid Control** - Deploy VLAs for humanoid robot task planning and execution
4. **Complete Capstone Project** - Integrate all modules into an autonomous humanoid system

## Module Content

### Week 11: VLA Introduction
- VLA model architecture
- Pre-trained models for robotics
- Language-to-action mapping
- Fine-tuning for specific tasks

### Week 12: Humanoid Integration
- Humanoid robot control with VLAs
- Task decomposition from natural language
- Integration with ROS 2 and Isaac Sim
- Multi-modal perception and action

### Week 13: Capstone Integration
- Complete autonomous humanoid system
- Voice interface implementation
- Task planning and execution
- Final capstone project presentation

## Capstone Integration

VLAs provide the **high-level intelligence** for your humanoid:
- Understand natural language commands ("Bring me the red cup")
- Decompose tasks into robot actions
- Plan multi-step manipulation sequences
- Adapt to dynamic environments

## Capstone Project

**Autonomous Humanoid System (Week 13)**

Build a complete system with 5 components:
1. **Voice Interface** - Speech recognition and natural language understanding
2. **Task Planner** - VLA-based task decomposition
3. **Navigation** - Autonomous navigation to target locations
4. **Perception** - Object detection and pose estimation
5. **Manipulation** - Grasp planning and execution
