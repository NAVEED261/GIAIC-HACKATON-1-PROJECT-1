# Module 2: Digital Twin Simulation

## Overview

In Module 2 (Weeks 6-7), you'll learn to create digital twins of robotic systems using Gazebo and Unity ML-Agents, enabling safe testing and validation before physical deployment.

**Duration:** 2 weeks (20 hours estimated)
**Weeks:** 6-7
**Prerequisites:** Module 1 (ROS 2 Fundamentals), basic 3D modeling concepts

## Learning Objectives

1. **Set Up Simulation Environments** - Configure Gazebo for robot simulation with realistic physics
2. **Create Robot Models** - Build and import URDF/SDF models with sensors and actuators
3. **Integrate Unity ML-Agents** - Use reinforcement learning for robot behavior training
4. **Test in Simulation** - Validate navigation and manipulation before hardware deployment

## Module Content

### Week 6: Gazebo Simulation
- Gazebo architecture and installation
- Creating simulation worlds
- Importing robot models (URDF/SDF)
- Sensor simulation (camera, lidar, IMU)

### Week 7: Unity ML-Agents
- Unity ML-Agents setup
- Environment design for reinforcement learning
- Training navigation policies
- Sim-to-real transfer techniques

## Capstone Integration

Digital twin simulation enables **safe testing** of your humanoid robot:
- Test navigation algorithms without hardware
- Validate manipulation strategies in simulation
- Train reinforcement learning policies safely
- Debug complex behaviors before deployment

## Assessment

**Gazebo Simulation Project (Week 7)**
- Robot model with sensors in Gazebo
- Simulated navigation task
- ROS 2 integration
