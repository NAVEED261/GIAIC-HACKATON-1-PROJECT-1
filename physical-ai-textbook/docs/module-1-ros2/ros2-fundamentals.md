# ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

In this chapter, you'll learn the foundational concepts of ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the middleware framework that powers modern autonomous robots. You'll set up your development workspace and understand the architectural improvements over ROS 1.

**Duration:** 8 hours
**Week:** 3
**Prerequisites:** Basic Python programming, command-line proficiency

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this chapter, you will be able to:

1. Explain the core architecture of ROS 2 and its key differences from ROS 1
2. Set up a ROS 2 workspace with proper directory structure
3. Understand the Data Distribution Service (DDS) middleware layer
4. Create, build, and run your first ROS 2 package
5. Use basic ROS 2 command-line tools (ros2 node, ros2 topic, ros2 service)
