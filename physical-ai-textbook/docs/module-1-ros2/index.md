# Module 1: ROS 2 Fundamentals

## Overview

Welcome to Module 1! Over the next three weeks (Weeks 3-5), you'll master the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the middleware framework that powers modern robotic systems.

**Duration:** 3 weeks (30 hours estimated)
**Weeks:** 3-5
**Prerequisites:** Basic Python programming, command-line proficiency

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. **Understand ROS 2 Architecture** - Explain the core concepts of ROS 2 including nodes, topics, services, actions, and the DDS middleware layer
2. **Create and Manage ROS 2 Nodes** - Build Python and C++ nodes that communicate via publish-subscribe patterns
3. **Implement Communication Patterns** - Use topics for asynchronous communication and services/actions for request-response interactions
4. **Build Multi-Node Systems** - Design and implement complex robotic systems with multiple interconnected nodes

## Module Content

### Week 3: ROS 2 Basics
- ROS 2 architecture and core concepts
- Setting up your ROS 2 workspace
- Creating your first nodes
- Understanding topics and publish-subscribe communication

### Week 4: Advanced Communication
- Services for synchronous request-response
- Actions for long-running tasks with feedback
- Parameters and launch files
- ROS 2 command-line tools

### Week 5: System Integration
- Building multi-node robotic systems
- Inter-node communication patterns
- Debugging and monitoring ROS 2 systems
- Best practices for ROS 2 development

## Capstone Integration

The skills you learn in this module provide the **communication layer** for your autonomous humanoid capstone project. You'll use ROS 2 to:
- Connect perception, planning, and control nodes
- Manage sensor data streams (camera, lidar, IMU)
- Coordinate navigation and manipulation subsystems
- Implement robust inter-process communication

## Assessment

**ROS 2 Package Project (Week 5)**
Build a functional ROS 2 package with multiple nodes demonstrating:
- Topic-based sensor data publishing
- Service-based configuration management
- Action-based task execution
- Launch file for system startup
