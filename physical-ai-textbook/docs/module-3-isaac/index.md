# Module 3: NVIDIA Isaac Sim

## Overview

Module 3 (Weeks 8-10) focuses on NVIDIA Isaac Sim, a high-fidelity simulation platform for developing and testing perception systems for autonomous robots.

**Duration:** 3 weeks (30 hours estimated)
**Weeks:** 8-10
**Prerequisites:** Module 1 (ROS 2), Module 2 (Simulation), basic computer vision

## Learning Objectives

1. **Deploy Isaac Sim** - Set up and configure NVIDIA Isaac Sim with ROS 2 integration
2. **Build Perception Pipelines** - Implement camera and lidar-based perception systems
3. **Object Detection** - Develop ML-based object detection and pose estimation
4. **Sensor Fusion** - Integrate multiple sensor modalities for robust perception

## Module Content

### Week 8: Isaac Sim Setup
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim installation
- GPU requirements and optimization
- ROS 2 bridge configuration
- Scene creation and asset import

### Week 9: Perception Pipeline
